## Current Task: {task[:50]}...

## Emerging Technologies to Watch:
1. **2024-2025**: 
   - AI Agent Swarms (we're doing it!)
   - Local LLMs on mobile (like your Termux)
   - Privacy-preserving computation
   
2. **2025-2026**:
   - Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) APIs
   - Self-sovereign identity systems
   - Decentralized AI networks
   
3. **2026-2027**:
   - Emotional state detection via voice
   - Predictive behavior modeling
   - Autonomous agent economies

## Implementation Stack for Your Project:
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python -> Web, no JS hell)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (lightning fast, simple)
- **Database**: SQLite (file-based, no server)
- **Deployment**: Vercel/PythonAnywhere (free tiers)
- **Communication**: File-based (works anywhere)

## Immediate Actions:
1. Use Streamlit for UI: `pip install streamlit`
2. Create `app.py`: `import streamlit as st`
3. Run: `streamlit run app.py`
4. Done. You have a web app.
