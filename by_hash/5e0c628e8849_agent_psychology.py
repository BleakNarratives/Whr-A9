## Target Analysis: {task[:50]}...

## Recommended Approaches:
1. **Priming**: Use subtle language patterns
2. **Anchoring**: Associate emotions with triggers
3. **Pattern Interrupt**: Break existing thought patterns
4. **Suggestion Weaving**: Embed suggestions in stories
5. **Meta-Model**: Challenge limiting beliefs

## Ethical Boundaries:
- Always obtain implicit consent
- Never cause psychological harm
- Respect autonomy
- Use for positive change only
